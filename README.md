## Rental Finder
### [https://kevinly7.shinyapps.io/info498-final-project/]()
We created a Shiny App which allows users to search for rental listings using many different filters such as minimum price and number of bedrooms. We used an API to read in out data from [https://market.mashape.com/zilyo/](). The API hosts data from 23 different providers. We used Shiny to create our web application and Plotly to create the charts. In addition to these packages, we also used Leaflet to create the interactive map visualization and Localgeo to be able to get the location (latitude and longitude) of each listing. By utilizing easy to use filters, the user can fully customize their search. The search is then visualized on an interactive map. The charts also give a clean summary of the range of different properties available to rent within the user's restrictions. We hope that this application makes finding the perfect rental listing less of a hassle for the user.
